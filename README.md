# The Value-Added Theory: A Unified Framework for Historical Evolution and National Competition

**Author:** Zhang Wei (@Hemono)

**Version/Date:** Final Draft V5.0 / June 11, 2025

**Introduction:**
> This project aims to construct and articulate an original intellectual framework named the "Value-Added Theory." By utilizing a unified analytical framework centered on "Value-Added Logic," this theory reinterprets the historical evolution of human societies, explains the rise and fall of nations in the contemporary era, and provides strategic guidance for future national competition. This project contains the complete structural outlines for a two-volume work.
